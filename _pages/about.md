I am an assistant research professor in the Earth and Environmental Systems Institute at Penn State University. I am also affiliate facutly in the Department of Philosophy and Rock Ethics Institute. 

My research addresses how values-based judgments can and should work together with evidence-based science and engineering in the study and management of climate risks.

Prior to joining the Penn State faculty, I held postdoctoral research positions at the London School of Economics and French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS). I received my PhD in philosophy and BS in mathematics from the University of Wisconsin.
